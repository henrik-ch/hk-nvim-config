This project is much inspired from https://github.com/josean-dev/ and his two videos:
- https://youtu.be/vdn_pKJUda8 <p>
- https://youtu.be/o4X8GU7CCSU


I will use the suggestions from the videos and make my own version of it.

## File Explorer

```
<SPACE> - E
for toggling the nvim-tree
```

## Pre-install steps

If you're on mac, like me, you can install iTerm2, Neovim, Ripgrep and Node with homebrew.
```bash
brew install --cask iterm2
```
```bash
brew install neovim
```
```bash
brew install ripgrep
```
```bash
brew install node
```

For XCode Command Line Tools do:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
